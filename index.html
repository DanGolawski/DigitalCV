            Hello recruiter. I'm Daniel and this is my digital CV. Let me explain myself. My goal is to be better than me yesterday. I achieve this through continuous self-development, work among inspiring people, supporting my team with full commitment.
            I am stock market investor interested in Data Science especially in Machine Learning. I dream to become Data Scientist. 
            My commercial, non commercial, investor and student experience made my speciffic mentality. In my opinion I am not typical candidate - I think nobody has sent you such CV.
            That is because I think like counterarian - I do not do as the rest of people.
            I have hope that we will meet and I will have opportunity to tell more about myself.
            Best regards.
